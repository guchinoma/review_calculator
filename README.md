# review_calculator

This is for those who are going to take some kind of exams. 
This Python program will give you the date when you have got to review what you want to learn in order to maxmize the effect of study.
The number of the function is eight: one day later. three days later. five days later, one week later, two weeks later, three weeks later, one month later, and three month later.

If time permits, I will write the additional program that links Google Calender, but I do not know when. The escape mark is for the sake of it.

This program runs when the Python's version is 2.7.2 or later, not 3 version.
